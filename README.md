LOGIN PAGE FUNCTIONALITY

This project is to demonstrate the login capabilites with Ionic using the 
Angular framework. the server.js file acts as an intermediary between the
front end and the back end with a PostgreSQL server. There is potential
for SQL injection due to the query being written directly as a string. will fix with
a query builder down the road.
